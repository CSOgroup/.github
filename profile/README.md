## Hello world ðŸ‘‹

- **[The Computational Systems Oncology lab](http://ciriellolab.org/)** integrates algorithmic design, data science, and molecular biology approaches to address relevant questions in cancer biology and therapeutics.
- Our group is embedded within the Department of Computational Biology of the University of Lausanne and a member of the Swiss Cancer Center Leman, the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, the Center of Precision Oncology of the CHUV and the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC)

- **Cancer Evolutionary Dependencies**
  - Cancer emerges through the occurrence and selection of molecular alterations. We aim to understand factors that favor or veto the selection of specific alterations, a.k.a. evolutionary dependencies (EDs). In particular, we focus on a concurrent or mutually exclusive selection of genetic alterations and whether these EDs can inform response to therapy.
- **Cancer Cell Plasticity**
  - Cancer cells can change their phenotype or even their identity without modifying their genetic code. We are interested in understanding epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming programs that underlie cancer cell plasticity. We study features of plastic reprogramming among different patients and within individual tumors, using cutting-edge single-cell and spatial-omics technologies. 
- **Chromatin 3D Architecture**
  - A key paradigm in biology is that structure determines function. Whether and to what extent this holds true for chromatin 3D architectures remains an open question. Here, we study chromatin structural changes in response to cancer genetic variants and epigenetic reprogramming. Our goal is to decipher chromatin plasticity and determine how it is hijacked in and/or influences tumor phenotypes.
